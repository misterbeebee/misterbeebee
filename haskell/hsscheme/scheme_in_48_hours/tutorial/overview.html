<h3>1. Overview</h3>
<p>Most Haskell tutorials on the web seem to take a language-reference-manual approach to teaching.  They show you the syntax of the language, a few language constructs, and then have you construct a few simple functions at the interactive prompt.  The "hard stuff" of how to write a functioning, useful program is left to the end, or sometimes omitted entirely.</p>

<p>This tutorial takes a different tack.  You'll start off with command-line arguments and parsing, and progress to writing a fully-functional Scheme interpreter that implements a good-sized subset of <a href = "http://www.schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/HTML">R5RS</a> Scheme.  Along the way, you'll learn Haskell's I/O, mutable state, dynamic typing, error handling, and parsing features.  By the time you finish, you should be fairly fluent in both Haskell and Scheme.</p>

<p>There're two main audiences targetted by this tutorial:<ol>
<li>People who already know Lisp or Scheme and want to learn Haskell</li>
<li>People who don't know any programming language, but have a strong quantitative background and are familiar with computers</li>
</ol>
The second group will likely find this challenging, as I gloss over several Scheme and general programming concepts to stay focused on the Haskell.  A good textbook like <a href = "http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> or <a href = "http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a> may help a lot here.</p>

<p>Users of a procedural or object-oriented language like C, Java, or Python should beware, however: You'll have to forget most of what you already know about programming.  Haskell is <i>completely</i> different from those languages, and requires a different way of thinking about programming.  It's best to go into this tutorial with a blank slate and try not to compare Haskell to imperative languages, because many concepts in them (classes, functions, 'return') mean totally different things in Haskell.</p>

<p>Since each lesson builds on the code written for the previous one, it's probably best to go through the lessons in order.</p>

<p>This tutorial assumes that you'll be using <a href = "http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC</a> as your Haskell compiler.  It may work with eg. <a href = "http://www.haskell.org/hugs/">Hugs</a>, but it hasn't been tested at all, and you may need to download additional libraries.</p>
